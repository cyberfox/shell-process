To compile, first set an environment variable IDEA_HOME pointing to the top level of your IDEA tree.

e.g.
  declare -x IDEA=/opt/local/idea10
  ant

You call it up with Alt-Shift-4.

If you have text selected it'll pass it to the shell command and
replace your selection with the output.  If you don't have text
selected it'll insert the output of the shell command.

If you do silly things, you'll get silly results...  e.g. 'sleep 10'
will freeze IJ for 10 seconds! If you do something that freezes for
too long, you can kill that process, and IJ will come back.

It does not work on Windows yet.
